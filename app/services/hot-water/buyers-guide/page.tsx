        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3 mt-6">Types of Hot Water Systems</h3>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#00E6CA] mb-2">Gas Hot Water Systems</h4>
          <p>Gas hot water systems are available in both storage and continuous flow options. They heat water quickly and are generally more energy-efficient than electric systems, resulting in lower running costs. Ideal for households with access to natural gas.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#00E6CA] mb-2">Electric Hot Water Systems</h4>
          <p>Electric hot water systems are available in storage and instantaneous models. They're relatively inexpensive to purchase and install but typically have higher running costs. Best suited for homes with off-peak electricity rates and areas without gas access.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#00E6CA] mb-2">Heat Pump Systems</h4>
          <p>Heat pump systems work like a refrigerator in reverse, extracting heat from the air to warm the water. They're extremely energy-efficient, using up to 70% less electricity than traditional electric systems, and are eligible for government rebates.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="mb-4">
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#00E6CA] mb-2">Solar Hot Water Systems</h4>
          <p>Solar systems use roof-mounted panels to capture the sun's energy and heat water. They typically include a booster for cloudy days. While they have higher upfront costs, they offer the lowest running costs and environmental impact, with available rebates to offset initial expenses.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3 mt-6">Factors to Consider</h3>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Household Size:</span> The number of people in your home determines the capacity you'll need</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Available Space:</span> Consider where the unit will be installed and space constraints</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Energy Efficiency:</span> Higher star ratings mean lower running costs and environmental impact</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Climate:</span> Your local climate affects the efficiency of certain systems, particularly solar and heat pump</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Initial vs. Running Costs:</span> Balance upfront purchase price against long-term operating costs</li>
          <li><span className="font-medium text-white">Available Rebates:</span> Government incentives can significantly reduce costs for energy-efficient options</li>
        </ul>
