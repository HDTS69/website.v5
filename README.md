## Cross-Browser & Mobile Testing

We follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and ensure our website works consistently across all browsers and devices:

### Testing Infrastructure

The project uses Playwright for automated testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (mobile and desktop).

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (desktop + mobile)
npm run test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run cross-browser compatibility tests
npm run test:cross-browser

# Test on desktop browsers only
npm run test:cross-browser:desktop

# Test on mobile devices only
npm run test:cross-browser:mobile

# Run Google Maps specific tests
npm run test:cross-browser:maps
```

### Test Coverage

Our tests verify:

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - Elements render consistently across browsers
2. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Proper display and functionality on mobile devices
3. **Google Maps Integration** - Maps and Places Autocomplete work correctly
4. **Navigation & Core Functionality** - Critical user paths work as expected

### Adding New Tests

When adding new features, create corresponding tests following TDD principles:

1. Write the test first to define the expected behavior
2. Implement the feature to make the test pass
3. Refactor as needed while maintaining test coverage

### CI Integration

Tests automatically run on pull requests to prevent regressions.
