                  <p className="text-lg font-medium">Hi there,</p>
                  <p>
                    I'm glad you've found your way here. My name's Hayden Drew, and
                    I'm the founder of HD Trade Services. After spending 14 years in
                    the trade, working on everything from plumbing to air
                    conditioning, I saw something in the industry that didn't sit
                    right with me. Too many businesses were overcharging or hiding
                    their pricing, leaving homeowners feeling frustrated and unsure
                    of who they could trust.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I wanted to do home services differently. For me, it's about
                    building relationships with people. I want to be your forever
                    plumber, gas fitter, roofer, and air conditioning specialist. I
                    want you to know that when you call me, I'll actually turn up
                    and do the job right.
                  </p>

                          This isn't just a business for meâ€”it's in my blood. As a
                          second-generation plumber who did my apprenticeship under my
                          dad, I learned early on that this trade is built on trust.
                          Every pipe I've fixed and every system I've installed has
                          reinforced what my father taught me: do honest work, show up
                          when you say you will, and treat people's homes with
                          respect.
                        </motion.p>

                        <motion.p variants={paragraphVariants}>
                          That's why I started HD Trade Services. For me, it's not
                          just about fixing leaks or installing systems; it's about
                          doing things the right way every single time. From the
                          moment you call us to the minute the job's done, we're
                          committed to being upfront, reliable, and transparent. No
                          surprises, no shortcuts. Just honest, quality work you can
                          count on.

                          I know how much your home matters to you because, like you,
                          I care about my own. That's why every service we provide,
                          whether it's a simple repair or a full installation, is done
                          with the same care and attention I'd give my own home. We
                          show up on time, do the job right the first time, and make
                          sure you're completely satisfied before we leave.
